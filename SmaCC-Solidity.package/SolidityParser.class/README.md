SolidityParser is a parser generated by SmaCC to interpret Solidity smart contracts. 

Description 
-------------------
SolidityParser can parse Solidity smart contracts. It also generates an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) from the parsed contract. 

This class was generated by Pharo SmaCC, and  it depends on the SmaCC runtime package (SmaCC-GLR-Runtime) to execute.

Please remember this class is just a parser. SoliditityParser does not perform semantic checks, nor can it detect logical or security problems. Errors detected by SolidityParser are only syntatic errors. 

SolidityParser is maintained at our github page:

Public API and Key Messages
-------------------	
- #parse / #parseStream  --- superclass methods to run the parser and generate an AST.


Examples
-------------------	
	"Please, see the SolidityParserTest class to find examples on contracts and how to parser them. There is no need to create an instance of SolidityParser to parse. Here is one simple example:"
	
	SolidityParser parseStream: 'contract Empty { }' readStream.	

	"Change the code inside the string to test any valid Solidity code'.
